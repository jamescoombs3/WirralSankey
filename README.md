# WirralSankey

The  post https://trak.org.uk/wirral/ describes a series of Sankey diagrams which exmaine the stratification of state schools in Wirral looking at: 
- Socioeconomic status [FSM|non FSM] (FSM = Free School Meals)
- KS2 Prior attainment [low|medium|high]
- Sex [Boy|Girl|Coed]
- Admissions policy [Grammar|SecMod]

The post was mainly about drawing the diagrams rather than inferring anything from them. 

This Spreadsheet and Jupyter Notebook can together recreate the Sankey diagrams in the post.
